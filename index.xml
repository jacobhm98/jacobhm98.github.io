&lt;p>I recently found myself with more free time and less direction than I&amp;rsquo;ve had since joining the prestigious ranks of &lt;em>real adults&lt;/em> sometime in my early 20s. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent the first week doing absolutely nothing productive. I tented for 4 days somewhere in the forest in southern Sweden while attending a techno festival, spent a combined 20 hours on trains to and from Cologne in order to attend a Denzel Curry concert with an old friend, and started reading a new book, &lt;a href="https://www.danielsusskind.com/growth-a-reckoning">Growth&lt;/a>, so far so good!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On leaving Spotify</title><link>https://jacobhm98.com/posts/leaving_spotify/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:56:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jacobhm98.com/posts/leaving_spotify/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="starting-as-an-intern">Starting as an intern&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Exactly 3 years ago, on the 13th of June 2022, I started my internship at Spotify. At the time I was based in Stockholm, on my way to finishing up a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in machine learning at KTH (hah!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spotify had been my dream company for a while before that. It was a tech product I genuinely loved using as a consumer, a huge success story closely affilliated with my own university, and it was chock full of cool engineering and ML feats obvious to any tech-literate user of the app.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jacobhm98.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobhm98.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Jacob Heden Malm.
