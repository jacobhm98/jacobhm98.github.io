&lt;p>Exactly 3 years ago, on the 13th of June 2022, I started my internship at Spotify. At the time I was based in Stockholm, on my way to finishing up a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in machine learning at KTH (hah!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spotify had been my dream company for a while before that. It was a tech product I unironically loved using as a consumer, a huge success story closely affilliated with my own university, and it was chock full of cool engineering and ML feats obvious to any tech-literate user of the app.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
